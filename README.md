## Countdown Timer Study

The goal of this exercise is to create three independently working game clocks that will tick down from 20:00 to 0:00.

Each game clock will need to implement three functions: start(), stop(), and reset().

The start() function will start the clock at it's current state, the stop() function will stop the clock at it's current state, and the reset() function will reset the clock at 20:00.
